# 🌌 Welcome to Aurora Theory!

Hey! Welcome to **Aurora Theory** — this is where we build cool and smart tools for quantitative finance. If you’re into trading algorithms and love clean, easy teamwork, you’re in the right place.

Right now, we’re all about working on **Meta-Filters**. Think of them as the secret sauce that helps our trading algorithms get better.

## Our Meta-Filter Development Workflow

Here’s how we usually do things:

1. **Get Your Assignment OR Make your own!**  
   Someone on the team will hand you a fresh Meta-Filter project alongside a paper with details on how it should work, basically your blueprint.
   If you already have your own theories, we would love to sponsor them!

2. **Fork the Base Repo**  
   - Start by grabbing the [`Base_MetaFilter`](https://github.com/AuroraTheory/Base_MetaFilter) repo — it’s like your Meta-Filter starter pack.  
   - Fork or clone it, then create your own repo named **`[TheoryName]_MetaFilter`**.

3. **Do Your Thing**  
   Build your Meta-Filter until it’s ready to get tested.

4. **Test It Out**  
   - Clone the [`Aurora_SDK`](https://github.com/AuroraTheory/Aurora_SDK) repo, where we put the Meta-Filters through their paces.  
   - Run your code, make sure it works well, and doesn’t break anything.

5. **Make It Production-Ready**  
   - If it passes testing, a senior dev will check it over and help make it solid for the real world.  
   - They might make some tweaks, but won’t do anything without letting you know.

## What’s Inside This Organization?

- **`Base_MetaFilter`** — The basic template for all Meta-Filters.  
- **`[YourName]_MetaFilter`** — Your personal Meta-Filter project repo.  
- **`Aurora_SDK`** — Where testing magic happens.

## Working Together

- We love pull requests — it’s how we share our work.  
- Every piece of code gets reviewed — everyone helps keep the quality high.  
- Senior devs jump in to help out and keep things production-ready.
